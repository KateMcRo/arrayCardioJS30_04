# Array Cardio Day 1

## Description

This is the fourth exercise in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 challenge. The challenge was to practice working with arrays and methods.

- My motivation was to continue to build my skillset
- A key takeaway for me was that you can use query select on any existing element- not just the document.
- Another exciting takeaway was console.table instead of console logs to make viewing data easier.
